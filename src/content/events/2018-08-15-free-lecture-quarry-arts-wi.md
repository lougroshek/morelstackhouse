### Course Description

Ortho-Bionomy is a gentle, osteopathically-based form of body therapy, highly effective for chronic stress, injuries, pain, or problems associated with postural and structural imbalances. The practitioner uses gentle movements and positions of the body to facilitate the change of stress and pain patterns. Strong focus is placed on the comfort of the individual and no forceful manipulations are used.

Ortho-Bionomy helps to alleviate both acute and chronic pain and stress patterns by reducing chronic muscle tension, soothing the joints, increasing flexibility, improving circulation, and relaxing the entire body. Ortho-Bionomy techniques are highly effective, easy to learn, easy on your body, and combine well with other bodywork and complimentary healing systems.
